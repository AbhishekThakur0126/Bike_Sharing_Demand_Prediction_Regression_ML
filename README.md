# Capstone-Project-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction-

Predicting the optimal number of bikes needed at any specific moment and day is a crucial and intricate business challenge. Striking the right balance is of paramount importance too few bikes can lead to resource inefficiencies, including maintenance costs and the need for parking and security infrastructure, while an excess of bikes can result in financial losses. These losses encompass immediate revenue reduction due to a limited customer base and potential long-term impacts, such as the erosion of customer trust and loyalty.

Predicting bike sharing demand can help bike sharing companies to allocate bikes better and ensure a more sufficient circulation of bikes for customers

Hence, it is imperative for bike rental enterprises to possess a robust demand estimation mechanism. This mechanism equips them to operate efficiently, maximize resource utilization, and ensure a seamless experience for their customers. Accurate demand forecasts are essential for informed decision-making and the overall success of bike-sharing businesses.My project is about making a predictive model which can help in predicting bike count required at each hour.
